# Wireframes / storyboards
> 
>*Original Setup: Introduce the state of the film industry by showing the drastic changes in the box office from pre-pandemic to pandemic, followed by the slow rise beginning in 2022 and the spike starting in 2023.*
> 
> Updated: Incorporating the feedback from the last assignment, I will start by introducing how IP-based films dominated the box office in 2023. I will also introduce the conflict of whether people want more original content and how streaming keeps audiences at home. I will also give a high-level explanation of what intellectual property is and how I will classify it in the story. We will conclude the setup with a visualization showing box office trends leading up to 2023 and low movie-going frequency in 2022.
> 
> *Initial Rising Action: We start to see a climb in box office numbers with hits like Super Mario Bros and Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse. As the story continues to rise, we will explore the popularity of the top 100 releases of 2023 by genre, both domestic and worldwide. We will also take a look at who is coming back to the theatre and why.*
> 
> Updated: I am keeping that we will discuss box office numbers based on genre popularity, but for the sake of this project, I am keeping everything from a domestic POV only. I looked into worldwide data, but the domestic data is enough to support the story since a lot of my single data points/statistical callouts of moviegoers are based on domestic audiences surveyed.
> 
> *Initial Climax:  Barbie is the highest point of our 2023 trends, and we will compare the film's box office stats to the other top movies of 2023. We will also explore demographic data from the opening weekend, the effects of the Barbie movie marketing strategy, and its potential correlation to its box office success.*
> 
> Updated:  This is still the story's climax, which will be seen by a change in color story as well. I will keep comparing Barbie to other top movies in 2023 and call out that Oppenheimer helped drive its success on opening weekend.
> I have also added a graphic that will encapsulate the effect of the Barbie marketing campaign across different age demographics.
>
> I initially wanted to find a correlation between the marketing response and the demographics who went to the movie. However, the marketing data breaks it out by generation without any description of the actual age numbers, and the movie-going data breaks it out by age group. Because of this, I could not find a good way to accurately represent this data without knowing how many people of each generation fall into a given age group. Using the marketing response visualization is more interesting and provides some different and valuable insight into the story, rather than continuing to report either box office numbers or attendance. 
> 
> *Initial Conflict: In this section, we will drive into some of the potential conflicts of our story. First, we will look at staying at home and streaming film vs. wanting to come to the theatre. We'll also dig into the question of whether or not audiences want IP-based films or more original content.*
> 
> Updated: I alluded to potentially adding information such as ticket pricing in my initial sketches and added that to this section.
>
> *Initial Resolution: To finish our story, we will examine the most anticipated films of 2024, how many are IP-based, and potential forecasting data.*
> 
> Updated: No major changes to this section. This is pretty straightforward!
>
> *Initial Call to Action
> Download Letterboxd: Watch films, review them, and join the conversation beyond the silver screen!
> Interested in supporting original works? Mark your calendars for the 2024 Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, March 21 - April 7, 2024!
> Whether you prefer IP-based films or original movies, head to the theatre on September 3, 2024, for National Cinema Day!*
> 
> Updated: I am still scoping out the best call to action, and that will largely depend on how I further define my audience. Right now, the presentation can be geared to both professionals and casual movie viewers, so the trick will be to find an appropriate CTA for professionals.
