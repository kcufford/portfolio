# Final Project: Part II

## Wireframes / Storyboards
>
> [**Link to Shorthand**](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ip-drives-the-box-office/index.html)  
>
> **_Original Setup:_** *Introduce the state of the film industry by showing the drastic changes in the box office from pre-pandemic to pandemic, followed by the slow rise beginning in 2022 and the spike starting in 2023.*
> 
> **Updated:** Incorporating the feedback from the last assignment, I will start by introducing how IP-based films dominated the box office in 2023. I will also introduce the conflict of whether people want more original content and how streaming keeps audiences at home. I will also give a high-level explanation of what intellectual property is and how I will classify it in the story. We will conclude the setup with a visualization showing box office trends leading up to 2023 and low movie-going frequency in 2022.
> 
> **_Initial Rising Action:_** *We start to see a climb in box office numbers with hits like Super Mario Bros and Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse. As the story continues to rise, we will explore the popularity of the top 100 releases of 2023 by genre, both domestic and worldwide. We will also take a look at who is coming back to the theatre and why.*
> 
> **Updated:** I am keeping that we will discuss box office numbers based on genre popularity, but for the sake of this project, I am keeping everything from a domestic POV only. I looked into worldwide data, but the domestic data is enough to support the story since a lot of my single data points/statistical callouts of moviegoers are based on domestic audiences surveyed.
> 
> **_Initial Climax:_**  *Barbie is the highest point of our 2023 trends, and we will compare the film's box office stats to the other top movies of 2023. We will also explore demographic data from the opening weekend, the effects of the Barbie movie marketing strategy, and its potential correlation to its box office success.*
> 
> **Updated:**  This is still the story's climax, which will be seen by a change in color story as well. I will keep comparing Barbie to other top movies in 2023 and call out that Oppenheimer helped drive its success on opening weekend.
>
> I have also added a graphic that will encapsulate the effect of the Barbie marketing campaign across different age demographics.
>
> I initially wanted to find a correlation between the marketing response and the demographics who went to the movie. However, the marketing data breaks it out by generation without any description of the actual age numbers, and the movie-going data breaks it out by age group. Because of this, I could not find a good way to accurately represent this data without knowing how many people of each generation fall into a given age group. Using the marketing response visualization is more interesting and provides some different and valuable insight into the story, rather than continuing to report either box office numbers or attendance. 
> 
> **_Initial Conflict:_** *In this section, we will drive into some of the potential conflicts of our story. First, we will look at staying at home and streaming film vs. wanting to come to the theatre. We'll also dig into the question of whether or not audiences want IP-based films or more original content.*
> 
> **Updated:** I alluded to potentially adding information such as ticket pricing in my initial sketches and added that to this section.
>
> **_Initial Resolution:_** *To finish our story, we will examine the most anticipated films of 2024, how many are IP-based, and potential forecasting data.*
> 
> **Updated:** No major changes to this section. This is pretty straightforward!
>
> **_Initial Call to Action_**
> *Download Letterboxd: Watch films, review them, and join the conversation beyond the silver screen!
> Interested in supporting original works? Mark your calendars for the 2024 Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, March 21 - April 7, 2024!
> Whether you prefer IP-based films or original movies, head to the theatre on September 3, 2024, for National Cinema Day!*
> 
> **Updated:** I am still scoping out the best call to action, and that will largely depend on how I further define my audience. Right now, the presentation can be geared toward both professionals and casual movie viewers, but as noted below, the CTA for casual viewers needed further clarification for some of the folks I interviewed.

## User Research Protocol: Goals, Audience, and Representative Approach

>As I seek out user feedback, I am hoping to gain a better understanding of how my story is interpreted and what parts could be enhanced or removed.  I mentioned in Part I that I have a ton of data and ideas to work with, so the key here will be narrowing down and finding focus. I also want to test if my call to action is strong enough from both audience perspectives.
>
> Audience:
>
> - General audience: members who are interested in specific IP, such as video games, and those who either enjoy IP-based films or those who are more interested in original stories.  In regard to the call to action, these people can become their own critics by downloading Letterboxd.
> - Industry professionals: Decision makers may want to know what is driving people to the theaters, what is keeping them home, and what titles are performing well. I am still scoping out what a CTA could be, and I am hoping to gain some insight from my audience's feedback.
>
>Keeping this in mind, I wanted to interview a mix of people with industry knowledge (MEIM students) and those with a general interest in movies or active participants in IP-based media (e.g., video games).
>
> - Male, early 30s, free-lance worker, avid video game player & casual movie watcher
> - Male, late 20s/early 30s, MEIM student
> - Female, early 20s, Public Policy student & casual movie watcher

### Interview script
>
> *Goal: Determine if the flow of the story in Shorthand make sense and is easy to follow*
> - What is your initial reaction to the layout/logic structure?
>
> *Goal: Ensure that there is a clear, defined story rather than a series of visualizations*
> - What story do you think is being told? Is it persuasive?
>   
> *Goal: What elements stand out?*
> - Was there anything you found new/surprising/interesting?
>   
> *Goal: I feel like I have a lot of information, all that supports the story, but I want to determine if it is too much/excessive and if anything could potentially be removed if it doesn't come across as essential*
> - Was anything unclear or maybe not needed to tell this story? Do the visualizations support the story?
>
> *Goal: Continue to scope out call to action and the strength of it*
> - What were your final thoughts at the end of the presentation? Did you feel a call to action, and if so, what?

### Interview findings
> 

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is your initial reaction to the layout/logic structure? | Looks nice and is well laid out. It is mostly easy to follow along with the logic.. | Everything was covered thoroughly, and the sequencing makes sense with the story.           | I liked that you did broad into more specific information. If someone doesn't know much about IP, then having a general background is helpful. It didn't feel like too much for someone who already knows what it is, so it wasn't too much to scroll through.           |
| What story do you think is being told? Is it persuasive?           |  That films based on IP are a top driver for revenue in the film industry, and persuasive in that it is telling you that films should be made off of IP if you want to make money     | The resurgence of the box office and how IP is affected if a bigger audience is brought in, as well as what the future holds. It was persuasive; If I didn't know all of this coming in, it makes a lot of sense.          | How IP boosted after Covid for the movie theatres. It was persuastive and helped me to understand the point of IP and made me want to go read more about it.           |
|  Was there anything you found new/surprising/interesting?                         |  I didn't realize how big of a revenue swing there was during the pandemic shutdown/reopening, and I didn't realize how many of the largest grossing films are based on IP.                              |  I didn't realize how far back the IP craze went.           |  Learning about what IP is!           
|   Was anything unclear or maybe not needed to tell this story? Do the visualizations support the story?                      |  The visuals support the story, but the following was unclear: The labels on the first line graph should be clearer that $8.91B is for 2023, not 2022. Maybe add a note that domestic refers to U.S. and Canada. For the top genres graph, maybe add a sub heading of IP vs. Original to further clarify. For the *Barbie* marketing, the legend is hard to read (too small)                               | Nothing felt unnecessary; it was succinct and supported.          | Nothing was unclear or felt not needed. Since this was all new information, I found the visuals helpful.  I really liked the black and yellow color scheme, and then the change to pink for *Barbie*, then going back to the main theme.           |
|  What were your final thoughts at the end of the presentation? Did you feel a call to action, and if so, what?                       |  Well done! I didn't feel called to action. As a casual viewer, it felt more informational than action-oriented. I guess I should go watch a movie? |  By the end, I could see where you were going with everything and made a strong point about IP's influence. I will maybe look into what's coming out in 2024 and feel inspired to go to the movies.           | I felt compelled to go read more about the topic of IP.            |

> ** Insights
> 
> Overall, I received positive feedback on the visualizations and general story outline.  There are a few elements to clean up on the visualizations, but the response was that it all supported the story. During the in-class critique, one classmate suggested making the Top Grossing Films of the Past 20 Years into a tree map (rather than a highlighted table) to make a bigger impact. Whereas another viewer noted that visualization stood out to them, with the data being a surprise. I may play around with this idea of a tree map and see if it fits with my vision for the layout. One of my goals with the feedback was to see if it was too much or just the right amount, and in this case, it felt like the right amount to my interviewees. 
>
> From the feedback I received both from my interviews and classmates, the main thing I need to focus on is the message for the casual viewer. I felt like I had a good grasp going in, but I can see where this needs to be improved. A common theme was that the story was interesting, but they did not feel compelled to go do something.  Along the same lines, one classmate noted that general people don’t think about IP when they go to the movies, so I should emphasize why they should go to the movies and incorporate that into the topic. Another note from the class was that if my call to action (Letterboxd) can be used for films both in and out of theatres (on streaming), why, then, is watching at home a bad thing? They were unclear on the main point that the story is to get more people to the movies and that IP has been driving the box office.

## Identified changes for Part III
> Going forward, I think I may narrow my focus solely on entertainment professionals/movie makers. This may help drive home the idea that in order to make more money at the box office, you need to take note of what trends, in this case IP, are doing the best. If there is a way to capitalize on it, then that would be the call to action. I have an idea in mind that would point professionals to a social listening site, Brandwatch, that could be used to gather data on what is trending and sentiment and could be used to develop a go-to-market strategy. If I go this route, I will still keep my set-up information about IP to provide the context for the story, even though industry professionals would already know what it is. I also plan to test the tree map idea noted above, and I will clean up my visualizations to ensure all of the important elements (legends, sub headings) are clear and informative. Lastly, I am continuing to workshop my title, and I will need to add my final pieces of text to Shorthand, where I currently have placeholders.
