# Final Project: Part III

## The final data story
> [**Link to Shorthand**](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ip-drives-the-box-office/index.html)   


## Changes made since Part II - Summary, Audience, Design Decisions
>
> Since I had most of my data story set up in Part II of this project, I felt I was in a solid place heading into Part III.  The most significant change I made was narrowing the scope of my audience to focus solely on studio executives. However, I wanted to be cognizant that this is a publicly available source and that I would be presenting to my classmates, so I included my informational setup that defines what IP is.
>
> The in-class feedback I received regarding my general audience CTA to join Letterboxed of “Why does it matter to me, a casual viewer if I can just watch and review these films at home?” made me re-think my audience and call to action strategy. I ultimately decided to go with a CTA to join Brandwatch, an online social listening website. The purpose of this CTA is that studios could invest in this resource to better understand how their films are being perceived online, conduct audience analysis, and use that research to change up their go-to-market strategy to drive more people to the box office. My part II grading feedback noted that this data story could be used to sway C-suite decision-making, and my final CTA acts as a pitch to executives to consider investing in this resource in order to improve their brand’s box office performance.

> Between Part II and Part III I made the following changes:
>
> **Domestic (U.S. & Canada) Box Office Revenue 1980-2022**
> - This visualization was initially through 2023. However, I received feedback in Part II that the label was hard to tell it was for 2023. So, I removed the 2023 label and updated it for 2022, as well as updated the title to end in 2022. I also realized that the next visualization refers to 2022, so it seemed like a better story to keep everything in the same year before moving onto the IP boom of 2023.
>   
> **Top Grossing Films of the Past 20 Years**
> - For this visualization, a classmate recommended that I try making a tree map to further emphasize the volume of IP films compared to non-IP. So, I created the visualization to include the Film Title/Year, and I categorized IP/non-IP by color. I asked one of my original feedback interviewees for their thoughts on the change. They thought it was unclear what the visualization was trying to tell – hierarchy? Order by year? If I wanted to include revenue volume, then maybe this visualization could work.
> - I thought about their feedback and decided that the story I am telling with this visualization is to simply draw attention to the two non-IP-based films out of the twenty.  I already have plenty of visualizations that showcase revenue, and this particular data is not a comparison of dollars. I also preferred my original visualization to the tree map once I created it; I didn’t want to add a tree map just for the sake of adding that particular visualization to the project if it didn’t support my story.
> - What I decided to do to make the data “pop” was utilize Shorthand’s scrolling effects. I start with an all-black background, and as you scroll, the two non-IP films are highlighted blue. I think this helps make the visual a little more dynamic when scrolling.
>
> **Call to Action**
> - As discussed above, I removed the general CTA of downloading Letterboxd and instead added a CTA button to view the Brandwatch website.
> 
> **Supporting Text**
> - In part two, I added a lot of placeholder text. As I delved into Part III, I cleaned up and added more text to finish off the data story. I tried to be mindful of not adding too much text in certain places, trying to let the data speak for itself. In areas where there is a little more text, I felt that the additional context was needed to support the story and/or the visualization.

## Final thoughts
> Looking back on my progression from Parts I to III, I came in initially with a clear idea of the story I wanted to tell.  Where I saw the biggest change, and the area that I needed to think about most throughout the process, was effectively scoping out my audience. The end result of focusing on studios only in Part III allowed me to deliver a clear and specific call to action that could benefit the audience.  I am really pleased with how my final deliverable turned out.  I think the decision to have one color story (black/yellow/blue) and change to pink for the climax (*Barbie*), helps indicate to the audience that something new is happening. When reviewing my initial sketches and data sources, I recognized that I had A LOT to work with! I knew up front that it was most likely too much, so throughout the process, I decided which pieces of data were the most vital to tell my story. I focused my feedback interviews on this aspect to determine if it was information overload. Although I still created many visualizations, I believe they all effectively tell the story.  Finally, when looking back at my goals of what I wanted to learn in this class, I think I succeeded in reaching them. I came in thinking I was going to need to learn how to make “cool designs” and try to use more unconventional/less-common visualizations for my final project. However, I found that keeping it simple is just as effective, and that is reflected in many of the design choices for my final deliverable. I am glad to have resources now to know when it is appropriate to use various types of visualizations.  I have gained the knowledge of best practices when making those decisions and designing these visualizations.
