# Critique by Design

### Part 1: Choosing a Visualization

When choosing a data visualization for this assignment, I wanted to find a topic that was of interest to me. The graphic I picked was originally posted on www.swimswam.com. This online news organization is the most-read swimming website in the world, and the article features a visualization of the percentage of women participants in the Olympics using data from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).  I grew up around sports and am an avid Olympics fan, so this article caught my eye.  Interestingly, the article not only provides a graph visualization but also includes a data table to show the specific percentage rates for each year. When reading the article and first looking at the visualization, I thought this would be a good context-driven visualization and one that can be easily accessible to a wide audience.
