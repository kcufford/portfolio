# Final Project: Part 1

## Outline
> It is no secret 2024 that Barbie was the smash hit at the box office in 2023, but was this a one-time phenomenon thanks to the “Barbenheimer” craze, or was there another driving factor? In my research, I am exploring the impact IP-based films have made at the box office and how these films have resurrected the movie-going experience in a post-pandemic era.
>
> The audience for this project is twofold: fans of movies and makers of movies.  For fans, they may approach this story with the following questions:
> 
> - What types/genres of movies are most popular and should I give those a watch?
> -	Which films are performing the best at the box office so I can see if they are worth the hype?
> -	Is my favorite IP a hit, and will that mean they might make more?
>
> For makers of movies, they may want to explore:
>
> - How well are our films doing in comparison to our competition?
> - What strategies can we implement based on the types of films that are most popular in theatres?
> -	What is driving people to return to the theatre, and how can we capture a larger audience?
>
> The overall story arc revolves around the question: Do audiences want IP-based movies? The box office data indicates so! The call to action encourages audiences to go to the theatre, watch new releases, and participate in the conversation.

### The Story
> **Logline:** 2023 was the year we came back to the movies, and IP-based films led the charge.
>
> **Setup:** Introduce the state of the film industry by showing the drastic changes in the box office from pre-pandemic to pandemic, followed by the slow rise beginning in 2022 and the spike beginning in 2023.
> 
> **Disordering event & Rising Action:** Enter the IP films of 2023.
> 
>We start to see a climb in box office numbers with hits like Super Mario Bros and Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse. As the story continues to rise, we will explore the popularity of the top 100 releases of 2023 by genre, both domestic and worldwide.  We will also take a look at who is coming back to the theatre and why.
> 
> **Climax:** Barbie Mania
>
> Barbie is the highest point of our 2023 trends, and we will compare the film’s box office stats to the other top movies of 2023. We will also explore demographic data from the opening weekend, the effects of the Barbie movie marketing strategy, and its potential correlation to its box office success.
>
> **Conflict:** Is IP enough to keep audiences coming to the theatre? Is “IP fatigue” setting in?
>
> In this section, we will drive into some of the potential conflicts of our story.  First, we will look at staying at home and streaming film vs. wanting to come to the theatre. We’ll also see if there is any impact from the SAG-AFTRA strikes that may have affected certain IP films, such as Blue Beetle, due to a lack of promotion. Finally, we’ll dig into the question of whether or not audiences want IP-based films or more original content.
>
> **Resolution:** 2024 Horizon
>
> To finish our story, we will examine the most anticipated films of 2024, how many are IP-based, and potential forecasting data.
